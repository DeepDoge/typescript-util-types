# What is this?

Utility tools for typescript

# How to install?

## Add it as submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/DeepDoge/typescript-util-types.git ./src/types/util
```

You can run these post install. (Add to npm run postinstall)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Manually

Just download the thing and throw it in your project.<br/>
Or use other solutions idk, I'm not adding this to npm.
